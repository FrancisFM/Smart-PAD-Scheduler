# Smart-PAD-Scheduler

This notebook has been built to take an existing full field development and optimize the development sequence of the pads. It was born from an attempt to minimize the parent-child interactions (time gap) while honouring the development schedule hard constraints (e.g. break-up season, water availability, start date, etc). Assessing the viability of a PADs sequence takes seconds instead of the traditional days. This significant time improvement allows running multiple iterations and it opens the door to identify an optimal schedule.

It handles hard constraints like drilling and completion windows. Soft constraints are also tracked in order to identify optimized development sequences.
